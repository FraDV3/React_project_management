# React Project Management App

A simple yet functional project and task management tool built with React and Tailwind CSS. This app lets users:

- Create and manage multiple projects

- Interact with a modal-based error system
- Practice reusable component logic and state handling

## 💡 Features

- 📝 **Task Management** – Add and delete tasks per project (tasks are scoped to the selected project)
- 📦 **Persistent Layout** – Projects listed in the sidebar for easy access
- ⚛️ **React Hooks** – Custom hook-based logic for managing state, refs, and controlled inputs
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – Clean, responsive design using Tailwind utility classes
- 💬 **Modals** – Custom modal component rendered via React Portals for alerts and messages
